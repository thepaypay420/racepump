Error: Failed to install 0.30.1, is it a valid version?
Failed to install `anchor`: failed to install `anchor` 0.30.1 with avm, using 0.32.1 instead
WARNING: `anchor-lang` version(0.30.1) and the current CLI version(0.32.1) don't match.

        This can lead to unwanted behavior. To use the same CLI version, add:

        [toolchain]
        anchor_version = "0.30.1"

        to Anchor.toml

WARNING: Adding `solana-program` as a separate dependency might cause conflicts.
To solve, remove the `solana-program` dependency and use the exported crate from `anchor-lang`.
`use solana_program` becomes `use anchor_lang::solana_program`.
Program name: `raceswap`
